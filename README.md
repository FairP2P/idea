# Ideaology 
we have to make the onramp and off ramp protocol for the indian rupees , which is almost robust , fraud proof , and does not able to make any of the irregularites to the system . 
## Onramp 
converting the  rupeees into the usdc coin  
here user is the buyer of usdc  
user is using the hdfc bank  
buyer send the upi transaction/ bank transfer to the seller off chain in the bank account  
seller usdc is locked usdc token in the escrow accounts 
can we use something like the gp where the amount need to , is halfed into two parts one for trade and for the collateral if you have done it wrong , if this trade is done correctly
